enterprise mobility management (emm) is the set of people, processes and technology focused on man-
aging the increasing array of mobile devices, wireless networks, and related services to enable broad use of
mobile computing in a business context. this is an emerging discipline within the enterprise that has be-
come increasingly important over the past few years as more workers have bought smartphone and tablet
computing devices and have sought support for using these devices in the workplace.
the main challenges of determining the right enterprise mobility strategy for an organisation is to relate the
available mobile it to the overall purpose of the work conducted, to determine how closely the business
process should be aligned to the mobile it, and how to support mobile workers when they are using these
devices in the workplace
