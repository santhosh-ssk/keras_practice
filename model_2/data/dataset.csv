handling of exceptions becomes very important to improve fault tolerance
▪ it also reduced the need for every product to handle exceptions individually, which reduces coding
time and also cleans the code.
▪ used spring framework for building common handler.
▪ project: built a framework for entering the rating for several buses based on their quality
▪ this tool was build for entering the rating for several bus services from 1 to 5.
▪ it helped the users of via.com to identify the quality of services provided by the buses based on their
rating.
▪ it increased the sales of high rated buses and forced operators with low rating to improve their
quality.
▪ project: entire rail product integration
▪ integrated the entire rail product in international team of via.com.
▪ integration included several api calls along with the complete backend development from searching
the rails to final booking.
▪ integrated the complete product using spring framework along with writing the entire logs to file.
▪ project: integration of user login for entire system including all products using session management

same names in the database.
▪ integrated the entire lucene search using ram directory for storing indexed data and different types
of tokeniser. and keyword analyser for efficient data search.
▪ project: created my own chrome extension named subseeker by scraping a site subscene.com

project i : real time provisioning gateway(rtpg)
description:
the real time provisioning gateway(rtpg) is a modular platform to allow t-mobile to invoke
business logic when a subscriber’s sim is moved from one device to another.
the rtpg solution consists of a core framework and one or more modules implementing business
logic. the framework provides the work flow to process requests and helper functions for the
modules to use (e.g. logging, database access, and ldap lookups). each rtpg module
encapsulates a specific set of business rules and actions.
examples of the actions that a module might take include:
 use spml to change the subscriber profile if a subscriber moves to a specific device
 use the imsi to look up the subscriber msisdn and use the msisdn to interact with","sol profile

enterprise mobility management (emm) is the set of people, processes and technology focused on man-
aging the increasing array of mobile devices, wireless networks, and related services to enable broad use of
mobile computing in a business context. this is an emerging discipline within the enterprise that has be-
come increasingly important over the past few years as more workers have bought smartphone and tablet
computing devices and have sought support for using these devices in the workplace.
the main challenges of determining the right enterprise mobility strategy for an organisation is to relate the
available mobile it to the overall purpose of the work conducted, to determine how closely the business
process should be aligned to the mobile it, and how to support mobile workers when they are using these
devices in the workplace
