▪ project: built a framework for entering the rating for several buses based on their quality
▪ this tool was build for entering the rating for several bus services from 1 to 5.
▪ it helped the users of via.com to identify the quality of services provided by the buses based on their
rating.
▪ it increased the sales of high rated buses and forced operators with low rating to improve their
quality.
▪ project: entire rail product integration
▪ integrated the entire rail product in international team of via.com.
▪ integration included several api calls along with the complete backend development from searching
the rails to final booking.
▪ integrated the complete product using spring framework along with writing the entire logs to file.

same names in the database.
▪ integrated the entire lucene search using ram directory for storing indexed data and different types
of tokeniser. and keyword analyser for efficient data search.

quality.
▪ project: entire rail product integration

 asa failover and the websense url filtering packet dissector for wireshark
wireshark is a network packet analyzer. a network packet analyzer will try to capture network packets
and try to display that packet data as detailed as possible.
wireshark tries to detect the packet type and gets as much information from the packet as possible. in this
run though, only the information shown in the packet list pane is needed. as the user selects a specific
packet in the packet list pane, this packet will be dissected again. this time, wireshark tries to get every
single piece of information and put it into the packet details pane. this dissection is possible only for
specific protocols that have dissector built for them.
built dissectors for the asa failover and the websense url filtering for which packet dissection was
not available.
