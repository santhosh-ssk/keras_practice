"product# 1 java virtual machine diagnostics (jvmd) - oracle india, noida"
role: senior manager (currently). duration: may 2008 - present
"technical aspects: java, j2ee, c, jni, adf, jsf, rest, web services, load"
"balancers, high availability, distributed architecture, performance tuning"
the product jvmd (which is part of oracle enterprise manager) is used to monitor/diagnose
java processes including any application servers in production which gives insight into the
performance and activity of the jvm including end to end transaction tracing. jvmd gives
insight at the jvm level. the product has an agent which is deployed on the jvm as an web
application (with native code called via jni) and which periodically samples jvm thread and
heap data via jvmti and heap traversal and sends this diagnostic data through http to
"another component called jvmd engine, which is a j2ee application running on weblogic"
server hosted on a separated machine. the jvmd engine processes data received from
jvmd agents. the engine periodically sends requests to the agent for diagnostic data and
also when user requests any real time jvmd data from ui. this data is stored in oracle
"repository for historical analysis (via ui), later and also aggregated to save tablespace. the"
ui is built on adf framework (mvc based). the technologies used are
"jsp,adf,servlet,ejb,jni,rest,software load balancer with high availability. the product"
facilitates cross tier analysis and enables drill down from the jvm threads into oracle
"database for a particular session, sql etc arising in the jvm, real time as well in history"
i have been instrumental in delivering a number of major and minor releases of the product
"across years, integrating the acquired product with oracle enterprise manager (which is a"
"big suite of products), fixing complex distributed customer issues, bugs, making high and"
"low level design of the product, functional specifications, mockups, coordinating work across"
"geographies, adding new features end to end, code reviews, unit tests, improving code"
"coverage, interviewing candidates, mentoring team members. i also lead the effort to offer"

"product # 4 livecycle - adobe systems, noida"
role: developer duration: january 2006 – apr 2008
"technologies: java, j2ee"
this was a soa architecture product in which we have different document services which
are plugged into the base container. these services perform different operations on the
"documents like converting an adobe form to pdf, applying digital signature on a pdf,"
combining two pdfs etc. i worked on the pdf generator module of it which deals with
"conversion of native documents like word, ppt, excel, html, ps, eps documents to pdf and"
vice versa. the service is deployed as a customized web service in the container and had
its implementation in java. we have some native c++ code too that is launched in a
separate jvm for the conversion. the customers could use soap/ejb/watch folder (a
directory in which user can put his file for conversion) and e-mail endpoints for conversion.

2. project name: api.next
project description: the api platform is focused on making it easier to create web (rest) apis.
comprises of essentially two major components:
a) core api: exposes core data and schemas
b) product api: composition of core api's into a single response
the motive is to make the platform highly scalable to the tune of being able to handle 10k+ requests per sec.
technologies like rxjava (async messaging) and hystrix have been incorporated in order to achieve this kind
of scale and resilience.
"environment: java, rxjava, spring-boot, mongodb, jax-rs (jersey 2.0), hystrix, gradle"
3. project name: sportware
project description: sportware project refers to the data ingestion process of sport feeds into the .com
backend system. the basic idea behind this module is to build a consolidated feed ingest processes so that it is
(as much as possible) common across all sports thereby reducing complexity and decreasing turnaround time
for new features. emerging technology (another group within espn) builds these xml feeds using oracle
stored procedures (as well as some additional oracle utilities to make creating xml easier) based on a set of
sport specific schema definitions (xsd’s) developed by .com.
"the code on the digital media side is split into three ""tiers""."
data tier:
this tier primarily includes:
 a set of common to all sports persistence java interfaces along with a jpa based set of pojos for
loading from / storing to sql. note that we could swap the sql implementation with something
else but there are no firm plans to do so at this time.
 a set of common data access objects which also provide client functionality for complex querying
of the data.
 a common sql schema for storing these pojos in a relational database.
 each sport then implements its own sport specific extensions to the above 3 items.
messaging tier
this is tier includes:
" a set of common xml schema definitions for ingesting ""feed"" data"
" a set of mdb’s (message driven beans) that connect to jms, validate the incoming message,"
"perform the unmarshalling, scrub the data, update the persistent store and update all relevant"
caches via push technology
 each sport then implements its own sport specific extensions to the above.
service tier
the service tier includes:
 all common and sport specific data providers
 client code to generically access all persistence objects and daos
 built in caching and cache management
 remote service access via rmi to all dao methods
 basic restful end points for all persistence objects
"environment: java, jpa(hibernate), jaxb, jms (websphere mq), ejb3(mdb, stateless session beans),"
"ehcache, jax-rs (jersey 2.0), sqlserver, glassfish, perforce"

project i : real time provisioning gateway(rtpg)
description:
the real time provisioning gateway(rtpg) is a modular platform to allow t-mobile to invoke
business logic when a subscriber’s sim is moved from one device to another.
the rtpg solution consists of a core framework and one or more modules implementing business
logic. the framework provides the work flow to process requests and helper functions for the
"modules to use (e.g. logging, database access, and ldap lookups). each rtpg module"
encapsulates a specific set of business rules and actions.
examples of the actions that a module might take include:
 use spml to change the subscriber profile if a subscriber moves to a specific device
 use the imsi to look up the subscriber msisdn and use the msisdn to interact with
an external system (e.g.voicemail)
 increment a statistics counter when a customer switches to or from a specific model of
phone

employment
1. hcl infrastructure services division (june 2013 – november 2013)
"underwent training on basics of networking, databases, linux and unix. received advanced"
training on it infrastructure library.
"project (disney): main responsibilities involved troubleshooting, maintenance and installation of"
patches on servers and vms. also responsible for escalating incidents to appropriate teams.
2. trimble (december 2013– present)
project 1: geomanager (dec13 – may14)
"brief description: geomanager is the product name for trimble’s asset-tracking, mobile and fleet"
management suite. geomanager helps its clients enhance their business operations and improve
productivity by capturing the location information of a mobile asset on a map in real-time. with this
"data, it helps clients to plan, optimize, and improve efficiency of field and mobile workers. the motto"
of geomanager is “workflow”.
"technologies used: java, oracle, svn, hibernate, jms, struts2, weblogic, httpd"
responsibilities: to implement specific functionalities and requirements for certain customers. to
improve the performance of the existing components in the solution to cater to constantly expanding
customer-base.
project 2: dom (dot-on-the-map) (jun14 – feb15)
brief description: dot-on-the-map (dom) involves cross-platform integration of two different
"trimble divisions viz., fsm (field service and management) and vss (virtual sight solutions: a"
trimble - caterpillar jv). geomanager is fsm’s product which enables customers to track and trace
their mobile and field workforce. visionlink is vss’s product which enables customers to locate
their heavy construction assets and plan utilization and maintenance tasks. there are customers who
"use both the above mentioned trimble’s solutions in their businesses. as a result, they had to log into"
two different applications to view and manage data. dom overcomes this caveat. dom extracts data
from visionlink and stores it in a cloud-based platform known as oculus (market name horizon) –
which is hosted on a common trimble-wide cloud called tpaas (trimble platform as a
service).dom solution enables geomanager to pull visionlink’s data from the oculus cloud and
display in its application’s ui. the customers can now see both geomanager and visionlink data in
the same map. a future roadmap and a more pragmatic vision of dom is to ultimately unite fsm and
"vss divisions by having all the webservices in an soa running on a single cloud-based platform,"
"such as oculus, which can then be consumed by both the divisions, thus preventing the repetition of"
solutions in various coding-languages and rather concentrating more on improving the overall
solution and also paving the way for attracting other divisions to join the cloud family.
"technologies used: java, mongodb, rabbitmq, struts2, svn, junit, apache tomee"
responsibilities: to develop components that implement account-management and role-based access
capabilities. to extrapolate the solution to customers across different regions.
project 3: oculus (mar15 – present)
"brief description: originating from dom, oculus is the next-generation platform aiming to replace"
"the older counterpart i.e., geomanager. oculus involves the development of plethora of things viz.,"
"core services (apis) to be consumed by web and mobile applications (android and ios), account-"
"management, identity-management, asset-tracking, logging, metering, reporting, exceptions and so"
forth.
"technologies used: java, mongodb, es, neo4j, spring, rest, soap, testng, mockito,"
"kafka, git, apache tomcat, nginx"
responsibilities: to write core web-services for consumption by various applications (mobile and
web). to develop certain new features such as streaming api to show the movement of fleet on a
map in real-time. to develop solutions for fault-tolerant event-processing systems.
